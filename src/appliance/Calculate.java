  Simulates a static class that will perform all necessary calculations on Appliance types
  for our application.
 */
/*
Declare your class final - Prevents extension of the class since extending a static class makes no sense
Make the constructor private - Prevents instantiation by client code as it makes no sense to instantiate a static class
Make all the members and functions of the class static - Since the class cannot be instantiated no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed
Note that the compiler will not prevent you from declaring an instance (non-static) member. The issue will only show up if you attempt to call the instance member
